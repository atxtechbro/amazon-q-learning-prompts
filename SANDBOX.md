# Tech Skills Gym - Sandbox Environment

A quick guide to creating isolated practice environments for your technical skill development.

## Setup

```bash
# Create a default sandbox
./setup-sandbox.sh

# Or specify a custom name
./setup-sandbox.sh linux-networking
```

## What You Get

- **Organized Structure**: Separate directories for code, data, and notes
- **Session Tracking**: Template for documenting progress
- **Starter Script**: Ready to begin your training

## Usage Principles

1. **One skill focus per sandbox** - Like isolation exercises
2. **Track everything** - Commands, errors, insights
3. **Progressive difficulty** - Start simple, add complexity
4. **Daily commits** - Build consistency
5. **Review and refactor** - Reinforce learning

## Example Training Paths

- **Linux**: Navigation → Text processing → Bash scripting → Process management
- **Containers**: Docker basics → Dockerfiles → Multi-container apps → Orchestration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → Testing → Deployment → Infrastructure as Code

## Session Workflow

1. Document starting point
2. Set specific goals
3. Record commands and outputs
4. Note challenges/insights
5. Commit progress
6. Plan next focus

Remember: Technical mastery follows the same feedback loops as physical training. Each 1% daily improvement compounds into expertise.
