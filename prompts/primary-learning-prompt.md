# Primary Learning Prompt

This is the core prompt pattern I'm developing for creating structured learning experiences with Amazon Q:

```
I want to learn [technology/skill] from beginner to proficient level. Please create a series of progressive exercises that will:

1. Start with fundamentals and build to advanced concepts
2. Present one exercise at a time
3. Wait for my completion before moving to the next exercise
4. Track my progress (e.g., "Exercise 7/14")
5. Allow me to ask follow-up questions without losing context

For each exercise:
- Provide clear instructions
- Explain why this skill is useful
- Show examples of expected output or behavior
- Offer hints if I get stuck

Press Y when you're ready to move to the next exercise.
```

## How to Use

1. Replace `[technology/skill]` with what you want to learn
2. Paste the prompt when chatting with Amazon Q
3. Follow the exercises one by one
4. Type "Y" when ready to move to the next exercise
5. Ask follow-up questions as needed

## Variations to Try

- Specify a particular aspect of the technology you want to focus on
- Request a specific number of exercises
- Ask for exercises of a particular difficulty level
- Request a specific time commitment per exercise
