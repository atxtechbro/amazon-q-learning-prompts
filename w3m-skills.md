# W3M Browser Learning Path

This prompt is designed to create a structured learning experience for mastering the w3m text-based web browser.

## Learning Prompt

```
I want to learn the w3m text-based browser from beginner to proficient level. Please create a Fibonacci sequence of progressive exercises (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) that will:

1. Start with fundamentals and build to advanced concepts
2. Present one exercise at a time
3. Wait for my completion before moving to the next one
4. Track my progress (e.g., "Exercise 3/8 - Fibonacci level 3")
5. Allow me to ask follow-up questions without losing context
6. Create a risk-free sandbox environment for practice

For each exercise:
- Provide clear instructions
- Explain why this skill is useful in w3m
- Show examples of expected commands or behavior
- Guide me through the process step-by-step
- Include keyboard shortcuts and command syntax

Press Y when you're ready to move to the next exercise.
```

## Why Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) provides a natural progression of complexity:

- **Level 1-2**: Basic navigation and viewing
- **Level 3-5**: Intermediate features and file operations
- **Level 8-21**: Advanced usage patterns and customizations

This creates a natural learning curve that starts simple and gradually increases in complexity, with each level building upon skills from previous levels.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end of this sequence, you should be able to:

1. Navigate websites efficiently using keyboard shortcuts
2. Download and manage files
3. Configure w3m for your specific needs
4. Use bookmarks and history effectively
5. Handle different content types (text, images, etc.)
6. Integrate w3m with other command-line tools
7. Customize the browser appearance and behavior
8. Understand security considerations in text-based browsing

## Session Tracking

To maintain continuity between sessions, use:
