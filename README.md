# Tech Skills Gym

A personal training ground where I apply progressive overload principles from bodybuilding to technical skill development.

## About Me

- 32-year-old software engineer with 4 YOE working remotely
- Former competitive gamer who discovered that the same grinding mindset works for bodybuilding and coding
- Transformed physique using "IFBB competitor" AI prompts in my apartment gym - now applying the same mental hack to technical skills
- No formal CS education - completely self-taught through an inherent desire to level up skills
- Not just a techbro or fitness guy - fundamentally a systems thinker obsessed with learning frameworks
- Tracks dotfiles as meticulously as macros - nothing exists without purpose
- Committed to daily 1% improvements that compound into expertise

## Core Philosophy

Technical mastery follows the same feedback loops as physical training:
- Set clear goals → Track performance → Identify weaknesses → Target challenges → Progressive skill building
- A craftsman must understand their tools completely - I refuse to use anything I don't understand
- Build in public, track everything with git, and learn through iteration, not perfection

## What's Here

This repo serves as my AI-powered coaching environment - creating a flywheel between:
- Structured learning paths with progressive difficulty
- Personalized technical exercises following the 5% rule (just beyond comfort zone)
- Systems thinking approach connecting isolated skills into cohesive expertise
- [Sandbox environments](SANDBOX.md) for safe experimentation - like a playground where you can run wild with commands without fear of breaking your system
  - Every learner needs a safe space to make mistakes and experiment freely
  - Our sandbox setup script creates isolated environments where you can practice destructive operations
  - Run `./setup-sandbox.sh` to create your own training ground
- [Training framework and methodology](INSTRUCTIONS.json) - detailed structure for progressive skill development

## Future Pipeline

- GitHub Actions to automate learning module delivery when PRs are merged in any repo
- Creating learning session issues to track progress and insights
- Sharing modules with others to gather feedback on their tech learning journeys
- Iterating based on real-world application, not theoretical perfection
- Pull vs push attitude: letting curiosity drive learning rather than rigid formulas

## Connect

- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/atxtechbro/dotfiles) - Configuration as meticulously tracked as macros
- [GitHub profile](https://github.com/atxtechbro) - Where my passion for continuous learning lives

## Current Focus

Backend, Linux, CI/CD, operating systems, and hardware - grinding skills with the same dedication I once applied to level 99 woodcutting in RuneScape, but with exponentially greater returns. Each 1% daily improvement compounds into human capital that creates leveraged value in a software-defined world.

Like a blacksmith mastering their hammer or a woodworker their chisel, I'm building deep expertise in the tools that shape my craft.
