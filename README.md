# Adaptive Session Coach: AI-Powered Skill Development

AI training helped me achieve world-class results in the gym (2023-2025). Now I'm applying those same principles to rapidly level up my tech skills.

## What's here

- Structured learning paths that follow gym-style progressive overload
- AI coaching sessions that adapt to my specific weaknesses
- A record of real skills I'm actively developing

## Core idea

The same feedback loops that work in physical training can work for technical skills:
- Set clear goals
- Track performance
- Identify weaknesses
- Target specific challenges
- Progressive skill building

## Current focus

Backend, Linux, CI/CD, operating systems, and hardware - using AI as my learning accelerator.

This repo is my experiment in creating a flywheel between AI coaching, skill development, and systems thinking.
