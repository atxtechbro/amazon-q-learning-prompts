# Amazon Q Learning Prompts

A repository documenting effective prompts for creating structured learning experiences with Amazon Q.

## What is this?

This repository explores how to transform conversations with Amazon Q into guided learning journeys. It documents my experiments with prompt patterns that create step-by-step learning experiences for technical skills.

## Why it matters

Traditional learning resources often lack interactivity or personalization. By developing effective prompts for AI assistants like Amazon Q, we can create:

- Progressive learning paths tailored to individual needs
- Interactive challenges with immediate feedback
- Adaptive pacing based on learner readiness
- Contextual follow-up discussions
- Hands-on skill development

## How to use this repository

The `AmazonQ.md` file contains the core prompt pattern I've found effective. Simply copy the prompt, replace `[technology/skill]` with what you want to learn, and paste it to Amazon Q. The AI will guide you through a series of exercises, like a gym workout for your technical skills.
