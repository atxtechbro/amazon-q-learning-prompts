# Adaptive Session Coach: AI-Powered Skill Development

A repository documenting structured learning experiences through AI coaching sessions that adapt to your progress and challenges.

## What is this?

This repository explores how to transform conversations with AI assistants like Amazon Q into personalized coaching sessions. It documents my experiments with prompt patterns that create adaptive, progressive learning experiences for technical skills.

The repository includes:
- Structured worksheets you can iterate through (like w3m-learning.md)
- Conversation starters for personalized coaching (like typing-skills.md)
- A growing collection of real-life skills I'm learning and tracking

## Why it matters

Traditional learning resources often lack interactivity, personalization, and adaptability. By developing effective prompts for AI assistants, we can create:

- Progressive learning paths that adapt to individual challenges
- Interactive exercises with immediate feedback
- Personalized pacing based on learner progress
- Contextual follow-up discussions that address specific weaknesses
- Hands-on skill development with continuous improvement

## How this works

Each file in this repository represents either:

1. **Structured Worksheets**: Like `w3m-learning.md`, which follows a Fibonacci sequence of exercises for progressive skill development
2. **Adaptive Coaches**: Like `typing-skills.md`, which creates a feedback loop where the AI analyzes your performance and generates targeted exercises
3. **Learning Frameworks**: Templates for creating your own adaptive learning experiences

The core principle is creating a feedback loop between:
- Structured exercises
- Performance tracking
- Pattern analysis
- Targeted practice
- Skill progression

## How to use this repository

1. Choose a skill you want to develop
2. Find or create an appropriate prompt file
3. Copy the prompt and paste it to Amazon Q
4. Follow the guided exercises, reporting your results
5. Let the AI adapt to your specific challenges
6. Track your progress over time

This creates a "gym workout" for your technical skills, with the AI serving as both coach and training program.

## Current Learning Paths

- `w3m-learning.md` - A structured learning path for the w3m text-based browser using a Fibonacci sequence of exercises
- `typing-skills.md` - An adaptive typing coach that analyzes your errors and creates targeted exercises

Feel free to contribute your own learning paths or share your experiences with these approaches. This is an emergent repository that will evolve as we discover more effective ways to learn with AI assistance.
