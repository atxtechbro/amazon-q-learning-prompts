# Tech Skills Gym

A personal training ground where I apply progressive overload principles from bodybuilding to technical skill development.

## Core philosophy

Technical mastery follows the same feedback loops as physical training:
- Set clear goals → Track performance → Identify weaknesses → Target challenges → Progressive skill building

## What's here

This repo serves as my AI-powered coaching environment - creating a flywheel between:
- Structured learning paths with progressive difficulty
- Personalized technical exercises following the 5% rule (just beyond comfort zone)
- Systems thinking approach connecting isolated skills into cohesive expertise

## Connect

- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/atxtechbro/dotfiles) - Configuration as meticulously tracked as macros
- [GitHub profile](https://github.com/atxtechbro) - Where my passion for continuous learning lives

## Current focus

Backend, Linux, CI/CD, operating systems, and hardware - committed to daily 1% improvements.
