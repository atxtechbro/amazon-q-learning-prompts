# Amazon Q Learning Prompts

A repository documenting effective prompts for creating structured learning experiences with Amazon Q.

## What is this?

This repository explores how to transform conversations with Amazon Q into guided learning journeys. It documents my experiments with prompt patterns that create step-by-step learning experiences for technical skills.

## Why it matters

Traditional learning resources often lack interactivity or personalization. By developing effective prompts for AI assistants like Amazon Q, we can create:

- Progressive learning paths tailored to individual needs
- Interactive challenges with immediate feedback
- Adaptive pacing based on learner readiness
- Contextual follow-up discussions
- Hands-on skill development

## How to use this repository

The `AmazonQ.md` file contains the core prompt patterns I've found effective, along with observations about what makes them work. Feel free to:

1. Try the prompts with your own learning goals
2. Adapt the patterns for different skills or technologies
3. Share your experiences and improvements
