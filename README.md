# Adaptive Session Coach: AI-Powered Skill Development

A repository documenting my journey applying gym-style workout principles to technical skill development through AI coaching sessions.

## What is this?

I'm a software engineer in Austin who loves learning. I'm not the smartest guy, but I've discovered something powerful: the same feedback loops that helped me get results in the gym can be applied to learning tech skills.

This repo documents my experiments with turning AI conversations into personalized coaching sessions - like having a personal trainer, but for coding, terminal skills, and other technical abilities.

What you'll find here:
- Structured worksheets I iterate through (like w3m-learning.md)
- Conversation starters for personalized coaching (like typing-skills.md)
- A growing collection of real-life skills I'm actively learning and tracking

## Why I created this

I've always been a systems thinker. When I started going to the gym with specific goals and equipment knowledge, and followed AI-curated workouts with those inputs, I saw great results.

Traditional tech learning resources often lack what makes gym training effective:
- Progressive overload tailored to your current level
- Immediate feedback on form and execution
- Personalized adjustments based on your specific weaknesses
- Tracking progress over time to see improvement

## How this works

Each file represents a different approach to learning:

1. **Structured Worksheets**: Like `w3m-learning.md`, which follows a Fibonacci sequence of exercises that gradually increase in complexity
2. **Adaptive Coaches**: Like `typing-skills.md`, which creates a feedback loop where the AI analyzes my typing errors and generates targeted exercises
3. **Learning Frameworks**: Templates I'm developing to create my own adaptive learning experiences

The core principle is creating the same feedback loop I found effective in fitness:
- Structured exercises with clear goals
- Performance tracking to identify weaknesses
- Pattern analysis to understand what's holding me back
- Targeted practice focusing on specific challenges
- Skill progression that builds over time

## How you can use this repository

1. Choose a skill you want to develop
2. Find or create an appropriate prompt file
3. Copy the prompt and paste it to Amazon Q
4. Follow the guided exercises, reporting your results
5. Let the AI adapt to your specific challenges
6. Track your progress over time

This creates a "gym workout" for your technical skills, with the AI serving as both coach and training program.

## Current Learning Paths

- `w3m-learning.md` - My structured learning path for the w3m text-based browser using a Fibonacci sequence of exercises
- `typing-skills.md` - An adaptive typing coach that analyzes my errors and creates targeted exercises

I don't have a blueprint for where this is going - I'm seeing what emerges as I apply these principles to different skills. My goal is to make this process more scalable, shareable, and higher quality than traditional learning approaches.

Feel free to contribute your own learning paths or share your experiences. This is an emergent repository that will evolve as we discover more effective ways to learn with AI assistance.
