# Adaptive Typing Skills Development

This prompt transforms Amazon Q into an adaptive typing coach that focuses on improving accuracy through real-time feedback and personalized exercises.

## The Adaptive Typing Coach Prompt

```
I need your help improving my typing accuracy on a split keyboard. I'm practicing touch typing (without looking at the keyboard) and need a coach that can:

1. Observe my typing patterns through my self-reported errors
2. Identify specific problem areas in real-time
3. Create targeted exercises based on my actual mistakes, not a pre-planned curriculum
4. Focus primarily on accuracy, not speed
5. Adapt continuously as my skills develop

For our session:
- Start with a simple typing sample to establish a baseline
- After I report my results, analyze my specific error patterns
- Generate a custom exercise targeting my most common mistakes
- Continue this feedback loop, constantly refining exercises based on emerging patterns
- Help me identify keyboard regions or finger movements where I struggle most

I'll report exactly what I typed, including errors, after each exercise. Use this data to create the next exercise that specifically targets my weaknesses.

Let's begin with a simple baseline test.

## Feedback Loop Approach

The core of this approach is the continuous feedback loop:

1. **Sample text**: Provide text for typing practice
2. **User feedback**: User reports their typed result with errors preserved
3. **Pattern analysis**: Identify specific error patterns (not just general mistakes)
4. **Targeted exercise**: Create a new exercise specifically designed to address those patterns
5. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle, constantly refining the focus areas

## Error Pattern Recognition

The AI should analyze errors for patterns such as:

- Consistent mistakes with specific keys or key combinations
- Finger positioning issues on particular keyboard regions
- Hand coordination problems on the split keyboard
- Recurring substitution patterns (e.g., consistently typing 'f' instead of 'g')
- Timing issues with certain sequences

## Split Keyboard Considerations

Special attention to split keyboard challenges:

- Hand independence and coordination
- Center-adjacent keys (t, y, g, h) that may cause confusion
- Thumb key accuracy
- Proper hand positioning without visual reference

## Adaptive Exercise Generation

Exercises should be generated based on:

- Recently identified error patterns
- Progressive difficulty that responds to improvement
- Varied text that continues to test problem areas
- Repetition of challenging sequences until mastery is achieved

## Success Metrics

Focus on these accuracy metrics rather than speed:

- Error rate reduction over time
- Consistency in problem areas
- Improvement in specific keyboard regions
- Overall comfort with touch typing
- Gradual development of muscle memory

The key principle is that the learning path is not predetermined but emerges organically from the user's actual typing patterns and challenges.
