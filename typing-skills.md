# Typing Skills Development Prompt

This specialized prompt is designed to help improve typing skills, particularly for users transitioning to split keyboards or working to increase their typing speed and accuracy.

## The Typing Skills Prompt

```
I want to improve my typing skills while adapting to a split keyboard. Currently typing around 30 WPM. Please create a series of progressive typing exercises that will:

1. Start with simple exercises and gradually increase difficulty
2. Each exercise should last approximately 30 seconds
3. Present one exercise at a time
4. Identify patterns in my mistakes and target those weaknesses
5. Track my progress across sessions
6. Provide specific feedback on my keystrokes and technique

For each exercise:
- Provide clear text to type
- Focus on different key combinations and finger movements
- Explain which skills this particular exercise develops
- Offer specific feedback when I report my results

After each exercise, I'll report my speed, accuracy, and any challenges. Based on this feedback, adapt the next exercise to target my weaknesses.

Press Y when you're ready to begin the first exercise.
```

## Exercise Structure

Each typing session should follow this pattern:

1. **Warm-up**: Simple exercises focusing on home row keys
2. **Targeted practice**: Exercises addressing specific weaknesses identified in previous sessions
3. **Challenge**: Slightly more difficult text to push skill development
4. **Analysis**: Review of performance with specific recommendations
5. **Cool-down**: Comfortable typing to end on a positive note

## Feedback Mechanisms

The AI should analyze reported results and provide feedback on:

- Hand position and ergonomics
- Problem key combinations
- Rhythm and consistency
- Error patterns
- Speed vs. accuracy balance

## Split Keyboard Considerations

Special attention should be given to:

- Thumb key usage
- Hand separation awareness
- Proper finger positioning without visual cues
- Transitioning between keyboard halves

## Progress Tracking

Track improvements in:

- Words per minute (WPM)
- Accuracy percentage
- Problem keys/combinations
- Comfort level with split layout

## Example Exercise Progression

1. Home row focus (asdf jkl;)
2. Reaching exercises (qwer uiop)
3. Vertical movement patterns (qaz wsx)
4. Common bigrams (th, he, an, in)
5. Alternating hand patterns
6. Common English words
7. Code syntax patterns
8. Full sentences with punctuation
9. Paragraph-length text
10. Technical terminology

The exercises should adapt based on user feedback, focusing more time on areas where improvement is needed.
